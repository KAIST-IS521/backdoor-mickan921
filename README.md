## File Description
* [**./interpreter/**](interpreter) : Reads in the bytecode generated by the [compiler](./compiler/) then executes it on the system
    * Implemented the functions to execute the bytecode.
    * Although I wrote the code myself, I have used [jaemoon-sim](https://github.com/KAIST-IS521/backdoor-jaemoon-sim), [JeongOhKye](https://github.com/KAIST-IS521/backdoor-JeongOhKye), and [blukat29](https://github.com/KAIST-IS521/backdoor-blukat29) as a reference.
* [**./login/**](login) : TODO

* [**./backdoor/**](backdoor) : TODO

* [**./compiler/**](compiler): Compiler that reads in the mini language code then translates it into a bytecode.
    * I justed used the default version that was given. I did not make any changes except for the manual copy and paste update from the Professor's update.


## What I learned
* I learned how an interpreter reads in the bytecode and executes them on a system
* I learned how to write code in mini language. Although I have done assembly coding before, it has been a while.
